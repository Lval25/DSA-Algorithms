#ðŸ“Š Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) with Python

I am actively strengthening my problem-solving skills by learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with Python, with a strong focus on writing efficient, scalable code and understanding performance through Big O Notation.

Key Areas of Study:

    Fundamental Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, Trees, and Graphs.
    Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, and Greedy Algorithms.
    Big O Notation: Analyzing time and space complexity to optimize code performance.
    Problem-Solving: Tackling LeetCode challenges and real-world coding problems.
    Optimization: Writing clean, efficient, and optimized Python code.

Current Focus:

    Implementing core data structures and algorithms in Python.
    Applying Big O analysis to evaluate and improve code efficiency.
    Enhancing coding skills for technical interviews and real-world applications.

This repository will feature Python-based DSA projects, coding solutions, and explanations of algorithm efficiency, reflecting my continuous growth in software development.
